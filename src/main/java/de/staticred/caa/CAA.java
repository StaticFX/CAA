/*
    CAA Console Application API

    Is a async fast api which can process console inputs async or if wished synced to your main program.
    Instead of having one command processed by a time, this api can process multiply commands at once.
    One large operation can be processed in the background, while the console is still accessible.

    It supports a command support for easy command access. All other inputs can be accessed via the ConsoleInputEvent class
    To use events head over to de.staticred.caa.events.eventapi
